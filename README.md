Overview
--------

This is a straight Python port of the following packages, including tests,

- https://github.com/mikunn/openapi-schema-to-json-schema
- https://github.com/wework/json-schema-to-openapi-schema (STILL TODO)

The purpose of these libraries is to enable you to correctly handle differences
between the OpenAPI 3 schema format and the JSON Schema format.
